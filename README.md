# Welcome to Child Friend

Hi! We are Child Friend!
<br>
Child Friend is a health enterprise that uses technology to solve health challenges faced by children, women, and rural communities.
<br>
<br>
Right now, we use tech to help keep kids healthy at school and create jobs for female nurses in Liberia.
<br>
<br>
In Liberia, diagnosing health problems can be really hard, especially in rural areas. That’s why we’re developing an AI-powered diagnosis and health support platform. It will help identify health issues faster and give support to children, women, and people living in rural communities.
<br>
<br>
Our technology makes healthcare smarter and more accessible, so everyone can feel safe and healthy!
